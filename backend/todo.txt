Certainly! Here's a detailed TODO list for implementing a Node.js backend with MVC architecture to support the features in your current frontend code:
1. Set up the backend environment:
Initialize a new Node.js project
Install necessary dependencies (Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, etc.)
Set up the project structure (controllers, models, routes, middleware, config)
Implement User Authentication:
Create a User model (MongoDB/Mongoose)
Implement user registration endpoint
Implement user login endpoint
Create JWT token generation and validation functions
Implement password hashing and comparison using bcrypt
User Profile Management:
Create endpoints for fetching, updating, and deleting user profiles
Implement skill level calculation based on completed courses and assessments
Course Management:
Create Course model
Implement CRUD operations for courses
Create endpoints for course enrollment and progress tracking
Assessment System:
Create Assessment model
Implement CRUD operations for assessments
Create endpoints for taking assessments and recording results
Social Feed:
Create Post model
Implement CRUD operations for posts
Create endpoints for fetching the social feed
Leaderboard:
Implement a scoring system based on course completions and assessment results
Create an endpoint for fetching the leaderboard data
Discussion Forum:
Create ForumTopic and ForumReply models
Implement CRUD operations for forum topics and replies
Create endpoints for fetching forum data and posting new topics/replies
Goal Management:
Create Goal model
Implement CRUD operations for user goals
Create endpoints for fetching and updating goal progress
Notification System:
Create Notification model
Implement a notification creation system for various events (course completions, forum replies, etc.)
Create an endpoint for fetching user notifications
Implement middleware:
Authentication middleware to protect routes
Error handling middleware
Request validation middleware
Implement data validation and sanitization:
Use a library like Joi or express-validator to validate incoming request data
Implement proper error handling and logging:
Create custom error classes
Implement a centralized error handling mechanism
Set up logging (e.g., using Winston or Morgan)
Implement rate limiting and security measures:
Add rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API
Implement CORS configuration
Add security headers (helmet middleware)
Create environment-specific configurations:
Set up environment variables for sensitive information
Create separate configurations for development, testing, and production environments
16. Implement database indexing and optimization:
Create appropriate indexes on MongoDB collections for improved query performance
Implement API documentation:
Use a tool like Swagger or API Blueprint to document your API endpoints
Implement testing:
Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha)
Write unit tests for models and controllers
Write integration tests for API endpoints
Implement data aggregation and reporting:
Create endpoints for generating reports on user progress, course popularity, etc.
20. Implement real-time features:
Set up WebSocket support (e.g., using Socket.io) for real-time notifications and chat functionality
Implement file upload functionality:
Add support for user avatar uploads and course material uploads
Create database migration and seeding scripts:
Implement scripts to initialize the database with sample data for testing and development
23. Implement caching:
Set up Redis or another caching solution to improve performance for frequently accessed data
24. Create a backup and restore system:
Implement regular database backups
Create a system for restoring data from backups
25. Implement API versioning:
Set up a versioning system for your API to allow for future changes without breaking existing clients
This TODO list covers the major backend features needed to support your current frontend implementation and provides a solid foundation for a scalable Node.js backend using MVC architecture. Remember to implement these features incrementally and test thoroughly as you go.
